# Final_Project_nflcombineR
The NFL combine is an event that allows NFL prospects to show off their athleticism and skills to NFL scouts and coaches to try and impress them enough for them to draft them or sign them to their NFL team. The NFL combine has multiple strength, agility and jump tests that shows off a players athleticism along with NFL drills that correlate directly to the field. I found the dataset on Kaggle. In this dataset is only up to the 2019-2020 NFL Combine so players drafted more recently won't be shown. 
For my R package I used an NFL combine dataset and created functions and plots to analyze players and to view players combine stats and even compared players to one another. I also created a function that builds an S3 object by taking the players name, position and college in a list and assigning it to the class "player". I used an MIT LICENSE so people can use my package. There are defensive programming in the functions. I also included my R Markdown on this repository as well as all the other functions DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE as shown in the previous Modules. I also included the .csv of the dataset I used for reference.
